# AI & Cybersecurity

This repository contains the final project for the course **"Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity"**, held at Politecnico di Torino during the 2024/2025 accademic year. The work focuses on exploring how modern AI techniques can be applied to cybersecurity problems, including network intrusion detection, malware classification, and threat pattern recognition.

The project is structured around four main lab sessions, each dedicated to a specific family of AI models and their application in a cybersecurity context.

## 🧪 Lab Descriptions

### 🔹 Lab 1 — Neural Networks for Cyber Threat Classification
In this lab, we developed and trained a basic **feedforward neural network** to classify different types of attacks based on network metrics. The main objective was to identify best hyperparameter for the NN and to find a good way to process data in order to achive the best possible performance.

### 🔹 Lab 2 — Sequence and Graph-based Models: RNNs and GNNs
This lab we used **RNN and GNN** to identify wheter a sequencec of API call was malicious or not.

### 🔹 Lab 3 — Natural Language Processing 
We explored **NLP techniques** to process malicious SSH session and label the different MITRE Techniques used by the attackers

### 🔹 Lab 4 — Anomaly Detection with Unsupervised Learning
In the final lab, we focused on **unsupervised methods** for anomaly detection, including autoencoders and clustering algorithms like DBSCAN. These techniques were tested on network traffic and system logs to identify outliers indicative of DOS attacks .
